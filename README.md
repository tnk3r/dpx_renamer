# dpx_renamer

simple file dialog to rename dpx files saved from resolve. Linux/OSX. Doesn't work on windows, 

Use the script at your own risk, the script will stop if it finds a DPX file which did not contain the filename Info. EI: a imported still saved into the gallery from a still, etc.. Works fine with video files for now.

App Tested on Yosemite 10.10.5. 

Binary File works with Linux, no need for .deb
